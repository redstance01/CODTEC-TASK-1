## Overview Of The Project

### Project: TO -DO LIST WEB APPLICATION

### Objective
 The objective of a  To-do list web application is to provide users with a digital platform to efficiently manage, track, and collaborate on tasks and projects.

 ### Key Activities
 **Task Creation and Editing:** Users can create new tasks, specifying details such as title, description, due date, priority level, tags, attachments, and any other relevant information.
**Task Organization:** Users should be able to organize tasks.

 ### Technologies Used
 **HTML**
 **CSS**
 **JAVA SCRIPT**

 ### Key Insights
 

**Flexible Input Methods:**

A good app should allow flexible task input methods. For example, Todoist uses natural language recognition, allowing you to type almost anything into the task field, and it instantly fills your to-do list2.

**Organization and Prioritization:**

To-do list apps help improve organization by centralizing all tasks in one place. They categorize tasks into sections like “Today,” “Upcoming,” and custom filters, helping you prioritize important work.

    
### Conclusions

App todo-list-app performs very efficient comparing to competitor. There is a space for further developments with regards of keeping app small and quick. It would be optimal to use dedicated CSS and continuing using vanilla JavaScript.

To-do-app can be developed as a sole application as well as a very efficient module to be combined in a larger project. One of the key challenges is to chose appropriate storage solution, that will allow to maintain its biggest advantages
